1. Open <https://osmdocs.com/>, and login into your account. If you are already logged in, press `My Books` top menu item.

2. Press `Add Book` button:

3. Enter book name. You can change it later, but keep in mind that book name is part of book URL, so changing it later will also change URL of every page of this book.

4. Leave other settings as is. These settings are explained in [Deploying Git Repositories](deploying-git-repositories.html) and [Using Your Own Domain](using-your-own-domain.html).

5. Press `Save` button. After the book is created, you should see it in the book list:

6. Your book is already live. Check it by pressing on its name.

You can edit book settings later or delete the book by pressing gears icon in the book list.
