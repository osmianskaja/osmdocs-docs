# Contributing To OsmDocs

I want this project to become community-driven.

It is released under open-source license. You can contribute to it on GitHub:

* <https://github.com/osmphp/docs> - a Composer package showing books as websites
* <https://github.com/osmphp/framework> - Underlying PHP framework

This documentation is already open-source. You can contribute to it on GitHub: <https://github.com/osmphp/osmdocs-docs>.

TODO. Detailed Guides
