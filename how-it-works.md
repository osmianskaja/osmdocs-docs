# How It Works

## Using Custom Domains

By default, every book's root URL is `https://osmdocs.com/{user}/{book}/`.

If you have purchased your own domain, show your book on it instead. So that book's root URL becomes `https://yourdomain.com/`.

This user guide is an example of using custom domain for book's root URL. As you can see, its URL is `https://docs.osmdocs.com`.

## Customizing OsmDocs

You can also download the open-source version of OsmDocs - the software which displays book files as a website - and install it on your server. 

Once installed, customize visual appearance and behavior of your copy of OsmDocs.

## Contributing To OsmDocs

And please, contribute back:

* Develop visual appearance of your book as a separate theme and publish it as a Composer package.
* Develop custom behavior of your book as a separate modules and publish your modules as a Composer package. 

 This way, everyone can easily install your themes and modules on their own copies of OsmDocs.
 
 Finally, please document your Composer packages. Use OsmDocs!
