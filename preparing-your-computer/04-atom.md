## Auto-Saving Files In Atom

After editing a file in Atom you normally have to press `Ctrl + S` to save changes to disk and to upload them to the server. It may lead to certain confusion, so let's enable auto-saving files whenever you switch from Atom to the browser:

1. Open Atom settings via menu `File -> Settings` or by using `Ctrl + Comma` shortcut, click on `Packages` tab and enter `autosave` into `Filter packages` text box:
