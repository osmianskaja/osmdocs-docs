# Contributing To OsmDocs

I would really appreciate your help! 

There are 2 main areas you can contribute to: documentation and code.

How to contribute:

* [open/comment/solve issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) in the underlying GitHub repository
* [send pull requests with improvements](using-version-control/team-workflow.html#contributors-and-forks)
* create your own modules and themes on top of OsmDocs and share them!

## Documentation Repositories

OsmDocs documentation files are on GitHub:

* <https://github.com/osmphp/osmdocs-docs> - this user guide

* <https://github.com/osmphp/framework-docs> - Osm framework developer guide. This framework does all the power-lifting in this project. Unfortunately, it goes mostly undocumented and is especially in need for your help 

## Source Code Repositories

OsmDocs source code is also on GitHub:

* <https://github.com/osmphp/docs> - a Composer package showing books as websites
* <https://github.com/osmphp/framework> - a Composer package containing Osm framework
