# Version Control

Having book copy locally as suggested in the previous sections of this user guide has yet another important benefit: you can put book files under version control. 

We will use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - the world's leading distributed version control system. Git is mostly used to store software's source code as it especially shines in handling text files. However, it is also often used to store documentation files. 
 
Using Git version control, you can:

* share it with other team members so that everyone can edit the same book on their own computers simultaneously and then merge individual efforts into the final result;
* see a clear change history of everyone's work; 
* host an additional book on OsmDocs displaying merged result of everyone's work from the Git remote repository.

In case you don't know what is Git and how it works, this section is just for you:

All the examples in this sections use Git command line. You can also do all these operations visually instead of the command line:
