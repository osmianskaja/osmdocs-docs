# Working In Teams

The basic idea is that that all team members should:

* have their own copies of the book on local hard drive under Git version control;
* edit their copies of the book locally and check its final appearance in their OsmDocs accounts;
* share their work with team mates by committing their edits into Git repository and pushing their commits to shared Git repository on GitHub;
* receive the commits of their team mates back from shared Git repository on GitHub and merge those edits into their local book copies.

In addition, one team member should have one more readonly copy of the book which is updated directly from GitHub, whenever push is made to shared Git repository on GitHub.

The following diagram illustrates the whole process:

The rest of this document provides step-by-step guide for a team member in such setup.

If you already know how Git works, read the [short version](#short-version) of this guide, otherwise go for the [long version](#long-version).
