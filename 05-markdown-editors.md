# Markdown Editors

You can edit Markdown files with any text editor, but I recommend using an editor specialized in Markdown.

Which one? I didn't make a comprehensive research on that. I tried [MarkdownPad](http://www.markdownpad.com/) and I liked it a lot. I tried [Atom packages for Markdown editing](markdown-editors/atom.html) and I liked them too.

So, just pick an editor and use it.
