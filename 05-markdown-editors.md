# Markdown Editors

You can edit Markdown files with any text editor, but we recommend using an editor specialized in Markdown.

Which one? We didn't make a comprehensive research on that. We tried [MarkdownPad](http://www.markdownpad.com/) and we liked it a lot. We tried [Atom packages for Markdown editing](markdown-editors/atom.html) and we liked them too.

So, just pick an editor and use it.
